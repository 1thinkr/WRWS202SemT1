				<h2>Special Effects</h2>
				<p>Some effects can only be achieved using scripting - which means using JavaScript, as there is currently no other universally supported client-side scripting language for the Web. You are probably familiar with colapsible lists. Clicking on one of the top categories, causes a sub-list to appear.
				</p>
				<p>A script can be used to implement a collapsible list on a Web page so that it behaves the same way as in a program. Generally, scripts allow designers to implement a more fluid style of interactivity on Web pages. Because not all browsers and devices used to access the Web support scripting, and some users disable scripting support to avoid the worst abuses it is prone to, it is important that the functioning of a page should not depend entirely on scripting - alternatives must always be provided.
				</p>
				<p>As with stylesheets, the absence of scripting may cause the user to experience a less attractive page, but it should never prevent them from seeing any of the page's content or deny them any of its essential functionality.</p>

				<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
				<p>Writing scripts is a form of programming and requires the same skills and attentions to detail. Most scripts used on Web pages are simple, though, and a high level of specialized programming knowledge is not required.
				</p>
				<p>Object-oriented programming is presently the dominant approach to the construction of computer programs. It is based on the notion that a program is a model of some real or abstract system, and can be composed from the interaction of objects which correspond to part of the system being modelled. Objects can be grouped into classes, all of whose members share certain general characteristics.

				<h2>The DOM
                    </h2>
				<p>There is no unique way of modelling any non-trivial system as a collection of objects. Much of the trouble with scripting on the Web resulted from several distinct models of Web pages being implemented in different browsers. However there now exists a standard in the form of the W3C Document Object Model, which should allow scripts to be written that will work in any browser that conforms to the W3C standards.
				</p>
				<p>The DOM is defined by several W3C Recommendations, referred to as DOM Levels 1,2 and 3. Level 1 defines the basic objects that allow XML and XHTML documents to be manipulated by scripts. Level 2 adds support for event handling and style manipulation. Level 3 goes further, refining the facilities in Levels 1 and 2, and provinding a standard way for scripts to access external XML data. Most browsers implement Level 1 and parts of Level 2.
